# Cracking-Caesar-Cipher.
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

# Cracking the Cipher
In the above implementations I have used frequency ananlysis and bruteforce to crack the cipher. 

**Frequency Analysis:** Ananlyzing the distrubution of letters to find the most letter nd then comparing it with the most common letter of English alphabets i.e letter 'E'.
**Bruteforce:** Self Explanatory
